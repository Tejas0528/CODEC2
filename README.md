# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data (Pure Python)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Sentiment Analysis Model** using **pure Python and NumPy**, without relying on external libraries like `nltk` or `sklearn`. The goal is to classify tweets as **positive** or **negative** based on their content, using a **custom-built Naive Bayes Classifier** and a manual **Bag of Words** approach.

## âœ… Features

- Manual text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenizing, removing punctuation)
- Custom vocabulary and Bag of Words implementation
- Naive Bayes classification without external ML libraries
- CSV file-based input/output for ease of data handling
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly structure

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset is a CSV file with the following format:

```csv
